# Classification with Decision Trees

**Lab by:** Thomas Haskell

## Description

This lab focuses on the application of the Decision Tree algorithm for classification, using patient demographic data. The objective is to build a classification model to predict the most effective drug for patients based on features such as age, sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. The lab is part of the IBM Machine Learning with Python Certification Course.

## Objectives

1. Develop a classification model using Decision Tree Algorithms, outputting probability of class membership
2. Visualize data and gain familiarity with pandas and numpy libraries.

## Dataset

An example of a multiclass classification involving patients with the same illness, all of whom responded to one of five drugs most effectively. Features of the dataset include age, sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol. The target is one of the five drugs: Drug A, Drug B, Drug C, Drug X, and Drug Y.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the zip file from GitHub.
2. Run the provided Python script to download the dataset.
3. Execute the lab script (`DecisionTree_Classification_Lab.py`).

## Pre-processing

- Explore and preprocess the dataset.
- Convert categorical variables (e.g., sex, blood pressure) to numerical values.

## Model Training and Evaluation

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Implement the Decision Tree algorithm with specified parameters.
- Evaluate model accuracy on the testing set.

## Visualization

- Visualize the trained Decision Tree to gain insights into the classification process.

## Results

- Compare the predicted values with actual values.
- Analyze the accuracy of the Decision Tree model.

This lab provides hands-on experience with Decision Trees for classification, offering insights into data preprocessing, model training, and result visualization.
